# Methodology of development and creation of simulation environments.
## Introduction
the purpose of this document is to provide you with the different methods, strategies and alternatives regarding the development of realistic simulation environments and how to create, optimize, manipulate and manage them.
## Slope
it should be clarified that this document emphasizes the worlds developed for the gazebo simulation environment, but this does not mean that the generated models or meshes cannot be modified according to other needs.
you can find more information about the repositories for which we have developed the methods here :
[GAZEBO](https://github.com/gazebosim) and [ROS]()
## Get it started
the following workflow outline presents the order and structure in which the method proposed here should be developed.
